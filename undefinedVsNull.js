Featured snippet from the web
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object. */
